# Chrome Dinosaur Game

For this project you are playing the typical chrome dinosaur game except that you have additional ability to shoot fireballs.

## Motivation

This projected was inspired by the typical chrome dinosaur game being too easy so I decided to make one where the enemies would spawn randomly and allow you to shoot fireballs. Just know that this game requires both luck and skill.
